## Project Description

This project implements a **Plant Disease Recognition System** that enables users to upload images of plants, which are then processed and analyzed using a pre-trained machine learning model. The model identifies various plant diseases, allowing users to take timely action.

The system is built using **Streamlit** for the frontend interface, **TensorFlow** for the model, and **NumPy** for data manipulation.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow**: Used for building and training the model.
- **Streamlit**: A Python framework for building the web interface.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing the confusion matrix and other metrics.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: Easily upload plant images for disease prediction.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Get instant predictions about the plant‚Äôs health.
- **Model Accuracy**: The model is trained using a comprehensive plant disease dataset with multiple disease categories.
- **Visualization**: Includes the ability to visualize training and prediction results, including a confusion matrix.

## Dataset
This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset. The original dataset can be found on this GitHub repo. The dataset consists of approximately 87,000 RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves, categorized into 38 different classes.

Training Set: 80% of the data used for model training.
Validation Set: 20% of the data used for validating the model.
Test Set: A new directory containing 33 test images created for prediction purposes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow streamlit numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
To run the system locally, follow these steps:

1. Start the Streamlit app:

## Training the Model
The model is trained using the `train_plant_disease.ipynb` notebook, which performs the following steps:

- Data Preprocessing: Loads and preprocesses plant disease images for training and validation.
- Model Architecture: A CNN model is built using multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by dense layers for classification.
- Training: The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function.
- Evaluation: The model is evaluated using both training and validation datasets.
- Saving the Model: After training, the model is saved as trained_plant_disease_model.keras.
The training process took 5 epochs, with the following results:

- Epoch 1: Accuracy: 24.37%, Validation Accuracy: 67.58%
- Epoch 2: Accuracy: 68.53%, Validation Accuracy: 81.42%
